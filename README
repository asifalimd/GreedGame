Requirements
------------
You need PHP5 host to run this code


Installation
------------
Simply map your document root of your host to web directory. The current version does not required any DB/other settings to configure.


How it works
------------
The dice score is calculated on based on the predefined points. See the below points
If there are tripple dice with same face value we give the below points
Tripple 1 => 1000
Tripple 2 => 200
Tripple 3 => 300
Tripple 4 => 400
Tripple 5 => 500
Tripple 6 => 600

Single 1 => 100
Single 5 => 50

All other conbinations will be treated as non scoring throws/dice.


If there are N dice drawn and there are more than one set of Tripple Dice with same dice value then I multiply the no of occurances with Tripple set points.

Ex: Dice Set [2,3,5,4,5,2,2,2,4,1,1,2,2,6,5,2]
There are 2 sets of Tripple 2's in this so we calculate the score for these sets is 2X 200 = 400
